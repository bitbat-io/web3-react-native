Lightweight React Native library for integration with Ethereum clients 

web3-react-native is a lightweight, highly modular, reactive, type safe React Native library for working with Smart Contracts and integrating with clients (nodes) on the Ethereum network.

**web3-react-native** is react native library that uses web3j underthe hood.

This allows you to work with the Ethereum blockchain, without the additional overhead of having to write your own integration code for the platform. And it uses native java code under the 
hood that keeps javascript thead of react native app free and app works smoothly.

Using web3js directly makes javascript thread busy thus, poor application performance.
